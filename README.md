## Manage Landing Page

The landing page is built using purely HTML and TailwindCSS. It is a sample landing page for a fictional product called "Manage". It is a responsive and visually appealing landing page design that showcases the key features and benefits of the Manage product. It utilizes the flexbox layout for responsive design.

This project was built mainly because I wanted to get conversant with TailwindCSS so I have not built functionality into it yet. The main focus was on design ie; TailwindCSS and CSS. You can access it at https://gitdela.github.io/tailwind-landing-page/
